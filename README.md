# FreeInfoSecTraining

I put this list together in order to share training and learning material for folks in information security and/or looking to move into the infosec field.<br />
<br />
In order to keep the list as concise as possible, I decided not to include every site on the internet with some training material, and instead focus on sites with larger repositories and repositories with specialized material.<br />
<br />
I review and update the list a few times a year, so please feel free to share links to this repo so others can stay up-to-date as well.<br />
